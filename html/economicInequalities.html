                <h3>Economic Inequality</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="card-text">
                <p>Brazil's citizens also face a multitude of economic divides. According to a Harvard study, the top one percent of the country holds roughly thirty percent of its wealth. This puts Brazil at the second highest income concentration in the world- a statistic many of the citizens can feel in their daily life. About 29 percent of Brazilian citizens live in poverty (I.e., living on less than $6.85 per day.), with slightly more experiencing food insecurities.</p>

                <h3>Causes</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-text">
                <p>Economic inequality is a complex blend of issues that stretch across the country, though a few key factors can be considered major contributors to this issue. Primarily, the country's education system can be heavily linked to the divide. A 2019 study by the Brazilian Geography and Statistic Institute found that roughly forty percent of Brazilians of 25 years or older did not have a primary education. A closer look revealed further inequality within the education system- double the rate of white youths are enrolled in college against their colored counterparts.</p>
                <p>The labor system itself has many flaws that contribute to the inequality; before COVID-19 hitting in 2020, the unemployment rate within Brazil had been on a steady rise since early 2012. This resulted in roughly 15% of the adult population, about 15 million, not having a job. Those who are employed still face an uncertain future- forty percent of the labor force work without the security of a contract. Additionally, much like the education system, racial inequality can be found within the job market. White workers enjoy a higher income than other ethnic groups, with the most startling difference found with black women. These women only receive roughly 45 percent of the average income that white men receive.</p>

			<h3>United Nation's Results</h3>

			<div class="card-text">
                <p>The first and second of the UN sustainability goals directly relate to the economic divide found within Brazil; primarily, the reduction or elimination of the economic inequality will have a significant impact on the poverty rates within the country. By bolstering the job market, providing equal access to quality education, and eliminating the pay gap based on race and gender, poverty rates in Brazil will doubtlessly decrease.</p>

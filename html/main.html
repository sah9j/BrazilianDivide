            		<h2>Brazilian Divide: Racial Inequality</h2>
        	</div>
		<h3>Brazil as a Country</h3>
		<p>
			Brazil is the largest country within South America, and the seventh most populated country in the world with 214 million inhabitants. Its capital of Brasilia is nestled within the center of the country; it was founded in 1960 and boasts a population of roughly 4.8 million- the third largest city within Brazil. The country’s most prominent religion is Christianity, with roughly 87 percent of the populous falling under this category. The country is also well known for the coffee it produces, exporting the most amount of coffee compared to any other nation; Brazil accounts for a whopping 40% of the world’s coffee trade. The country’s favorite sport is football (for the American audience, soccer), with some of the best football players hailing from Brazil.

		<h3>Brazil's History</h3>
		<p>
			Before being founded in 1822, the region was home to a diverse set of tribes. These tribes, however, were soon pushed out of their lands by the Portuguese, and by the mid 1900’s suffered an 80% decline in their population. Brazil was officially founded when Pedro I declared independence from Portugal and formed the Empire of Brazil. As time progressed, Brazil became a republic. Multiple revolutions occurred starting in the 1920’s to overthrow the corrupt republic government, becoming a fully dmeocratic by the early 1980’s. Today, Brazil still democratically elects its leaders, though civil unrest is still prominent during these elections.

		<h3>What Divides Brazil?</h3>
		<p>
			Today, Brazil faces many divides within the country. Sexism, economic gaps, and racial prejudices can be found within the populace. This website will explore the different inequalities that divide the country, and how they can relate to the UN sustainability goal of reducing inequalities across the board. Each page focuses on one of the major inequalities that face Brazil’s population, and explains how overcoming them will align with the United Nation’s goals.

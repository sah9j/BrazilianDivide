							Christianity is the most prominent religion within the country, and its heavy influence is prominently displayed. One of Brazil’s largest landmarks, Christ the Redeemer, is a 30 meter statue that watches over Rio de Janeiro, the country’s second most populated city. This religious influence is no surprise- 87 percent of the population’s belief is in Christianity. However, the prominence of Christianity is on a sharp decline; in 1970, 90 percent of the population was considered Catholic. As of 2010, this figure has dropped down to 65 percent.

							The current and historical prominence of Christianity in Brazil can be traced back to the first colonizers of the region. The Portuguese brought with them Roman Catholicism, and sought to make the ‘savage’ tribes that called the region home more ‘civilized’. One major aspect of this was converting them, if possible. Additionally, there was not such a thing as religious freedom at the time- it was common law that people must pay taxes to the church, and their religion must be Catholic. As time progressed and Brazil became a country, religious freedom was adopted. Despite this, the popularity of Catholicism is deeply ingrained within the country’s citizens.

							On the topic of religion, it is also important to note the large amount of diversity found within Brazil. The combination of religions that were brought over with Africans, along with the multitude of religions developed by the native tribes that inhabited Brazil, has influenced the country in small but unique ways. Despite the heavy hand of Catholicism in the country’s past, many of these religions were kept alive despite the attempted eradication of them. One such Religion is the Yoruba- it was brought over from Africa, and survived before Brazil adopted religious freedom. Below is a informative video on the nature of this religion, and how it influenced the country.

							As stated previously, the popularity of Christianity is in its decline in Brazil. The country has seen a decline in its overall church attendance, and studies have shown that progressively less people identify their religion as Christian. Catholicism has seen the worst decline, with its members either becoming atheist, or joining the Protestant church.

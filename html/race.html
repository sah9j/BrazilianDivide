            		<h2>Brazilian Divide: Racial Inequality</h2>
        	</div>
		<h3>Racial Inequality</h3>
		<p>
			Racial prejudice is another major divide found within Brazil’s borders. The ethnicity of the citizens are relatively evenly split, with the ethnic majority of Brazil bring white- roughly 48 percent of the inhabitants falling under this category. Approximately 43 percent are mixed race, and 7 percent are black. Despite this relative equality in terms of ethnic populations, those who are not white often draw the short end of the stick. The implications of having a darker skin color has a negative affect on education, jobs, and overall quality of life.<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Causes</h3>
		<p>
			Much of the racial inequality found within Brazil can be traced to the myriad of inequalities that citizens with darker skin deal with. Primarily, the economic issues, such as unequal pay and access to jobs, are the greatest obstacle. According to Edward Telles, a professor of sociology at the University of California, whites are comparatively five times more likely to be in the highest income bracket, and on average, earn 46 percent more than comparable colored employees. While already a disheartening statistic, the issue only becomes more prevalent when the statistic in the opening paragraph is taken into account; the ethnic populations are relatively equal to each other, with only five more percent of the population being white.<br><br>
			Due to this economic divide, the colored residents of Brazil are less likely to have money to spend on quality education. This can rapidly become a downwards spiral- lack of education can bar entry to higher paying jobs, lack of quality income means less money for education. However, education can pose a challenge even without the economic gap. Ellis Monk, a professor of sociology at Harvard, found that skin color is proportionate to the amount of education received. Those who had darker skin colors were 26 percent less likely to receive further education. Additionally, white students were found to be given better assessments over equally proficient black students.<br>
		</p>

		<h3>UN Results</h3>
		<p>
			The UN Target states that a country must “empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.”  To address the root causes of the racial inequalities of Brazil, equal access to quality education no matter the skin color must be first and foremost. By guaranteeing this, access to higher paying jobs among the mixed and black ethnic groups will be achieved, allowing for more equal social and economic opportunities while dismissing racial stereotypes.<br>

            		<h2>Brazilian Divide: Gender Inequality</h2>
        	</div>
		<h3>Sexism</h3>
		<p>
            While Brazil has made great strides in gender equality during the recent decades, sexism is still a prominent issue in the country. According to the world economic forum, a study revealed that women had gained roughly equal status in both healthcare provided and education. However, jobs, pay, and overall safety have yet to catch up; sexual harassment and domestic violence are still commonplace fears than many female citizens of the country face.
		</p>

		<h3>Violence</h3>
		<p>
			The women of Brazil are often targeted in domestic violence; a study has shown that 10 to 15 women are murdered each and every day. Further studies conducted by the Brazilian government in 2015 revealed that over 70 percent of the female population will suffer some form of violence in their lifetime. Sadly, a lot of this violence can come from their partners, with roughly 35 percent of such incidents resulting in the husband or boyfriend as the culprit.
        </p>

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>
            Not everything is bleak, however, and the push for gender equality has yielded great results. The literacy rates between male and female citizens are roughly equal, only distinguished by a few tenths of a percentage. Before the 1980’s, women who attended college only went to learn practical, common household skills- not the usual higher education material that is generally associated with colleges. However, as of the late 2000’s, the number of women in higher education has increased, with just over half of all college attendee’s being female. While male dominated courses, such as those focused on national defense and agriculture, still exist, women dominate the fields of psychology, literature, and arts.
		</p>
        <h3>Economic</h3>
        <p>Despite this marked improvement in education, women still face persecution in workplace environments. High ranking government jobs are still dominated by men, with only 9 percent of such jobs having female representation. On the more commonplace jobs, females earn less than their male counterparts on the regular; in common labor positions, women earn roughly 21 percent less on average than their male counterparts. Furthermore, despite the equal access to education mentioned above, the pay gap widens in educated job roles. Women earn 32 percent less in jobs centered around health, education, and other social services.
        </p>
        <h3>UN Goal</h3>
        <p>    The United Nations targets and indicator 10.4  states that Brazil must “Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality.” Through adopting wage laws that guarantee equal pay regardless of gender, the government can provide gender equality economically. Additionally, stricter laws advocating for women’s safety in both public areas and at the home will reduce, and hopefully eliminate, violence against women.
